# My React Native Journey

## Short Ridiculous Story

One day, a friend of mine asked me an intresting question:-
- **Friend**: How has it been for you as a web developer?
- **Me**: Hmmm, I am not sure how to 'React' to this question
- **Friend**: Well, 'Natively' I guess.
- **Me**: Okay then. I will React Natively then.

and here we are today!

Let's React Natively Together. Join Me!

*THE END*

*GLORY TO GOD*
